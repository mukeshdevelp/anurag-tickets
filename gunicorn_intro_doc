## Introduction

`Gunicorn` (Green Unicorn) is a **high-performance Python WSGI HTTP server** used to deploy Python web applications in production environments.
It acts as the bridge between a web application (such as Flask, FastAPI, or Django) and incoming HTTP requests by managing workers, processes, and efficient request handling.

Gunicorn is lightweight, reliable, battle-tested, and widely used across the Python ecosystem for running **API services, microservices, and backend applications**.

## Why Gunicorn?

Python applications speaking HTTP natively isn’t efficient or scalable — the built-in Flask/Django development server is meant **only for local development**.

Production requires:

* Handling multiple requests simultaneously
* Process and thread management
* Graceful restarts and failure handling
* Scalability across CPU cores
* Security and configuration flexibility

Gunicorn is used because it:

* Provides a **robust production-grade server**
* Efficiently distributes requests to multiple worker processes
* Makes Python apps **faster, scalable, and reliable**
* Integrates seamlessly with **reverse proxies like Nginx**
* Supports advanced tuning (worker types, threads, timeouts)

Gunicorn forms the deployment backbone of modern Python applications, especially in **containerized and cloud-native environments**.

## What Gunicorn Does

Gunicorn acts as the server that:

* Accepts HTTP requests from the outside world
* Spawns worker processes to execute Python application logic
* Manages concurrency and throughput
* Gracefully restarts workers on crash
* Logs errors and runtime insights
* Serves WSGI-compatible applications efficiently

**Typical Deployment Flow:**

```
Client → Nginx → Gunicorn → Python App
```
