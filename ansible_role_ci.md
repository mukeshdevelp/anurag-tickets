## 1. Purpose

This document explains a simple **Continuous Integration (CI) workflow**.  
Its goal is to:
- Automatically check code
- Find issues early
- Keep builds stable and reliable  

This helps teams deliver better quality software faster.

---

## 2. Scope

This CI workflow applies to:

- **All repositories (frontend, backend, services)**  
  The workflow is designed to support different types of codebases, ensuring consistent build, test, and validation processes across all application components.
- **Feature, release, and bug-fix branches**  
  CI checks are triggered on all major development branches to catch issues early and maintain code quality throughout the development lifecycle.
- **Developers and DevOps teams**  
  Both development and operations teams rely on this workflow to automate validation, reduce manual effort, and ensure reliable software delivery.


## 3. What is Continuous Integration (CI)?

Continuous Integration means developers regularly push their code to a shared repository.  
Each change is automatically checked using builds and tests.

## 4. Why CI is Important

- Issues are detected early  
- Code quality improves  
- Fewer problems reach production  
- Development becomes predictable

## 6. CI Workflow Components

### 6.1 Source Code Management (SCM)

- Code is stored in Git repositories  
- Direct commits to the main branch are not allowed  
- Pull Requests are mandatory  
- CI must pass before merge  

### 6.2 CI Trigger

CI pipelines run automatically when:
- Code is pushed
- A Pull Request is created or updated
- Code is merged into main branches

### 6.3 Build Stage

**Purpose:** Prepare the application to run.

Includes:
- Installing required libraries
- Building the application

If the build fails, the pipeline stops.

### 6.4 Test Stage

**Purpose:** Make sure the code works correctly.

Includes:
- Unit tests
- Integration tests
- Basic sanity checks

This stage prevents broken code from moving ahead.
### 6.5 Code Quality Checks

**Purpose:** Keep code clean and secure.

Checks include:
- Code structure
- Duplicate code
- Security issues

Common tools:
- SonarQube
- ESLint
- Snyk

### 6.6 Artifact Generation

**Purpose:** Create final build outputs.

Examples:
- JAR or WAR files
- Docker images
- Python packages

Artifacts are stored for later use.
### 6.7 CI Status & Feedback

CI results are shared using:
- Pull Request status (pass/fail)
- Email or chat notifications
- CI dashboards

This helps teams take quick action.

---
## 7. Conclusion

A simple and well-defined CI workflow helps teams deliver stable and high-quality code.  
It reduces risk, saves time, and improves overall software reliability.
