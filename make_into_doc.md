## Introduction

`make` is a powerful build automation utility commonly used in software development to **compile code, run workflows, manage dependencies, and automate repetitive tasks**.
Using rules defined in a simple configuration file (`Makefile`), Make determines what tasks need to be executed and in what order — ensuring only required steps are run.

Make originated in the UNIX ecosystem and continues to be one of the **most widely used automation tools** in DevOps, CI/CD, and open-source projects.

## Why Make?

Modern software projects often require:

* Compiling source code
* Running test suites
* Packaging artifacts
* Regenerating files when dependencies change
* Automating multi-step commands

Without automation, developers must execute many commands manually — which is **slow, error-prone, and inconsistent**.

`make` solves these problems by:

* Automating command execution
* Understanding what needs to be rebuilt based on file changes
* Enforcing repeatable builds across machines
* Reducing human mistakes
* Eliminating redundant tasks
* Serving as a simple build orchestrator (even outside C/C++)

Make continues to be a **foundation of build automation**, used directly or indirectly by:

* Linux kernel
* GNU projects
* Docker image builds
* CI tools (GitHub Actions, Jenkins, GitLab CI)
* Infrastructure automation workflows

## What Make Does

At its core, Make:

* Uses a **Makefile** to define tasks (targets)
* Tracks **dependencies** between files
* Executes rules **only when required**
* Allows **custom commands**, not just compilation
* Works with **any language or script**
